# tmd-prot-ligand-analysis
analyses of MD simulations - ligand transport by MtrD 

Background: we performed Targeted Molecular dynamics simulations of protein-ligand systems
Program: NAMD 2.12, CPU and GPU-accelerated
System: MtrD (wild type), and RND Transporter from _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_
Ligands:  Azithromycin, Streptomycin
Analysis: uses VMD 1.9.3 scripting interface to produce datasheets, then python to organize + graph them
